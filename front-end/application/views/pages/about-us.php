                            <p>The word “Education” comes from the Latin word, ‘educare’, which means to bring out   the   divinity   from   within.   Intellectual   education   influences   the   head and   value-based   education   influences   the   heart.   For   a   progressive   society,   we need  both  of  these.  We  all  have  heard  the  saying;  children  of  today  are  citizens of  tomorrow.  Teachers  play  a  crucial  role  in  bringing  out  the  best  in  the  children, both in terms of competence and character & thereby in the overall progress of the nation.</p>

For   us,   education   is   a   sacred   service   that   one could render to the society and not a mere business.

                                A  common  problem  any  faculty  experiences  while  teaching  to  set  of  variegated children  is  to  satisfy  the  needs  of  both  the  quick  learners  &  the  rest  of  the  crowd.  If  the concepts are taught at a basic level, the quick learners feel bored & if the concepts are taught at an advanced level, the slow learners feel very difficult to comprehend.

                                In either of the cases, the children lose confidence & interest towards their academics & often get discouraged and perform way below their potential.

                            <p>There are plenty of Institutes that train Students for IIT/NEET/KVPY in Bangalore as of today. After extensive research, we have observed that most Institutes Impart Theoretical Knowledge  to  the  Students,  but  very  little  exposure  is  given  to  the  students  on  Problem Solving. At Arjunaa Academy for Achievers(AAA), we Impart Deep Understanding of the Concepts to the Students and also solve problems of various levels and various types so that Students are exposed to all kinds of Problems that appear in the Competitive Exams. </p>

                            <p>
                                Another unique feature of AAA is that we provide Video Solutions to every Question/Problem of our Module. Usually, many Institutes provides Tabs to the Students where printed Solutions for their material is uploaded. However, the drawback with the Written Solutions is that not all Students understand how the Teacher arrived at a Particular Step.

                                <p>
                                Video Solutions on the other hand gives Students the Insight as to where they usually go  wrong  and  also  exposes  them  to  solve  the  same  problem  in  various  ways  providing different  perspectives  to  the  same  problem. Another  Unique  Feature  at AAA  is  that  we provide Video Solutions for Every Test unlike other Institutes who provide Answer Keys for the Test. In short, at AAA we believe in constantly innovating & improvising to better the Students’ performance.

                            <p>The best part of Arjunaa Academy is undoubtedly the Teachers, who are constantly guiding,
                                supporting and encouraging us. It is inspiring to hear from them their own success
                                stories and
                                their vision for us. Also, the moral values imparted to us have changed us for the
                                better, so I
                                absolutely recommend Arjunaa Academy for anyone aiming for success.

                            <p>Probability the best center in Bangalore for quality coaching for competitive exams. The coaching is top notch, teachers are dedicated and want us to learn. Doubts are clarified on whatsapp even at 9 in the night, and unlike some other big brands in this coaching field, this academy is not a business. Personally it is helping me to improve in my studies a lot. Would recommend for any student serious about cracking JEE or KVPY or NEET.
